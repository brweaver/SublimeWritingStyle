SublimeWritingStyle
===================

Improve your writing style with this Sublime Text package. 
This plugin supports both Sublime Text 2 and 3.

Why Should I use this package?
------------------------------

Practicing your writing skills will make you a more effective communicator.

How exactly does this package help?
-----------------------------------

It does two things. First, it helps you use *active voice* instead of *passive voice*.
Consider these two sentences:

- The car was driven by the boy. 

- The boy drove the car.

Which one is simpler? (Hint, it's the second, active one.) Using active voice simultaneously makes your text shorter and more engaging to the reader. Unfortunately, it takes some practice to spot passive sentences. 
Passive voice indicators are forms of *to be* (am, is, are, was, were, be, been, being) plus another verb (often ending in *ed*).

Second, this package highlights *weasel words*. Use these judgmental words sparingly. A few examples: *very, clearly, and, relatively*. 

Both the list of passive voice indicators and weasel words are customizable using Sublime Text settings files.  Use the `extra_words` settings key to define additional highlighted words.

Who inspired this package?

[Stefan Brunthaler](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sbruntha/) extended the [writegood-mode](https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode) for [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) in a similar fashion.
